#TODOS:

#### VITAL

* DOCUMENTATION - Need to update the README.md file to have updated information

#### SOON

* FIX NEEDED - gulp.run() (Used by gulp-watch) is depreciated

#### POSSIBLE

* FIX - For .NET projects we need to auto add all files that are updated into the project XML
    OR We could see if the build process for .NET could do the same functionality as blastoff
